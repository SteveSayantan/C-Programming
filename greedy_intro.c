    Feasible Solutions:
    -------------------
    There might be more than one solutions for a particular problem. The solutions those satisfy the given condition/constraint to solve the problem are known as feasible solutions.

    Optimal Solution:
    -----------------
    A feasible solution that offers minimum cost/best result is called an optimal solution. Only one optimal solution can exist for a particular problem.
    
    Optimization Problems:
    ---------------------
    A problem that requires either minimum or maximum solution is called an optimization problem.

    Different Strategies used to solve Optimization Problems:
    ---------------------------------------------------------
    1. Greedy Method
    2. Dynamic Programming
    3. Branch and Bound

    Greedy Method
    -------------

        Approach :
        --------
        Here, a problem is solved in stages. At every stage, the best option available is chosen . In this way, ultimately we can get the optimal solution.

    Dynamic Programming
    -------------------

        Approach :
        --------
        Dynamic Programming is mainly an optimization over plain recursion. Wherever we see a recursive solution that has repeated calls for the same inputs, we can optimize it using Dynamic Programming

        It either uses memoization or tabulation method .
